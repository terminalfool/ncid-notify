Version 0.9.14
    Macintosh:
      - Fixed up ncidpop for Mac OS X so it compiles with Xcode 3.x and on
        Intel.  The project files in the current ncidpop release are too
        old to even be imported by current versions of Xcode, and an API
        being used was deprecated and not endian-safe.
      - Added some Windows version features (history and reverse lookup).
      - Cleaned up the popup display as it was hard to read in a hurry when
        someone was calling.
    Windows:
      No Changes

      non-standard window managers.
    - Fixed one of the URLs in ReverseLookupURLs.txt

    - Macintosh: Code, broken in Version 0.9.6, updated and compiles again.
                 Call History features not yet implemented.

Version 0.9.9
    - Changed NCIDpop to allow the telephone number reverse-lookup
      URL to be configured in the Preferences dialog (substitution
      is applied for the actual phone number--see the URLs
    - Some possible URL's can be found in the file: ReverseLookupURLs.txt

    - Added a refresh button to the call history dialog.

Version 0.9.7
    - The tray icon will show if NCIDpop is connected to ncidd.

      help to disappear before it should).

Version 0.9.6
    - enhanced the Windows version of NCIDpop to include a call
      history dialog.
    - If you double-click on a call in the call history window, it
      will perform a anywho.com search on the phone number. This will
      do a reverse lookup of the phone number and if the number is
      found, it will show name, address and a link for a map.

Version 0.9.5
    - No longer requires patched ncidd; uses TCP to connect to a
      specified Network Caller ID server.
    - Added dialog to set caller ID server host.
