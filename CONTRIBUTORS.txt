Alexei Kosut:
    Designed and wrote most of the programs.

Lyman Epp:
    Wrote the new features for the Windows version of NCIDpop
    contained in Versions 0.9.6 through 0.9.13. Finished the
    Windows installer.

Mark Salyzyn:
    Updated the Macintosh code, in version 0.9.10, so it would
    compile with the common files used by the Windows version.

Joe Nardone:
    Submitted patch for non-standard window managers.

Rich West:
    Created the Windows installer.

Nicolas Riley:
    Fixed up ncidpop for Mac OS X so it compiles with Xcode 3.x and on
    Intel.  (The project files in the current ncidpop release are too old
    to even be imported by current versions of Xcode, and an API being used
    was deprecated and not endian-safe.  Added some of the other Windows
    features (history and reverse lookup).  Also cleaned up the popup display
    as it was hard to read in a hurry when someone was calling.

Chris Lenderman
    Fixed problems and added features in the Windows version of NCIDpop 0.9.16 and 0.9.17.0

David Watson v0.9.17a
    Forked 0.9.17 for Mac osx and directed caller display to osx notification center. Removed
    growl functionality, resolved methods deprecated under os 10.8.
