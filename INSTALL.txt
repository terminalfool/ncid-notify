Mac OS X

This application uses the OSX Notification Center (10.8+).

Copy the NCIDnotify application to your hard drive. Double-click to launch
it. There will be no visual indication, but you can verify that it is
running by looking for "NCIDnotify" in Activity Monitor. NCIDnotify will
automatically quit when you log out or shut down your Mac.

To launch NCIDnotify automatically when you log in to Mac OS X, add it to
the Accounts > Login Items panel in System Preferences.

To change the NCID server, hold down the Command key while opening the
NCIDnotify application.

To view your call history, open NCIDnotify again (after it is running). 
Or, more simply, open your notifications panel.


Running a NCID Server

Before you can use NCIDnotify, you will need to be running a Network
Caller ID server. NCIDnotify is designed for use with ncidd. When NCIDnotify
first starts, you will need to enter the hostname or IP address of the
server running ncidd. If the server is running on the local computer
(currently possible only with Mac OS X), enter "localhost". If you
make a mistake, see the directions above to change the NCIDnotify server
setting for your operating system.

If you are running ncidd on a non-default port (i.e., not 3333),
enter the server name followed by a colon and the port number, e.g.,
callerid.domain.name:1234.
